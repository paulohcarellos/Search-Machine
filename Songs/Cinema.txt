I could watch you for a lifetime
Your my favorite movie
A thousand endings
You mean everything to me
I never know whats coming
Forever fascinating
But you don't stop running
To me 'cause I'll always be waiting
You are
A cinema
I could watch ya forever
Action
Thriller
I could watch ya forever
You are
A cinema
A Hollywood treasure
Love you
Just the way you are
A cinema
A cinema
Get up get down
Lose that sound
My DJ gonna break it down
Get up get down
Lose that sound
My DJ gonna break it down
Get up get down
Lose that sound
My DJ gonna break it down
Get up get down
Lose that sound
Dr-dr-dr-dr-dr-dr-dr-dr-drop the bass!
A cinema
The stars spell out your name
Like in a science fiction novel
Romance growin'
Like a flower in the summer
You always keep me guessin'
Forever my wonderful
Hope you start undressin'
All my dreams and take me under
You are
A cinema
I could watch ya forever
Action
Thriller
I could watch ya forever
You are
A cinema
A Hollywood treasure
Love you
Just the way you are
